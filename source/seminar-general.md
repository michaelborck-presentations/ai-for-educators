# **Session Title: AI for Educators – Understanding Instructions at the Heart of AI**
**Target Audience:** Faculty and Teaching Staff
**Time:** 60 Minutes

## **Part 1: The Real Barrier (10 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Address AI shame and fear directly before diving into techniques.

* **AI Shame:** 70% of knowledge workers use AI weekly, but 63% fear being seen as incompetent. Most hide their AI use.
* **The Reframe:** Using AI thoughtfully is a professional skill. Hiding it prevents growth.
* **Your Expertise Matters MORE:** AI handles routine tasks; YOU provide judgment, connection, inspiration. Students need you MORE, not less.

## **Part 2: The Core Concept (7 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Establish that "instructions" are at the heart of ALL AI.

* **The "Intern" Analogy:** AI is like a brilliant intern who hallucinates occasionally. It needs clear instructions and verification.
* **The Golden Rule:** *AI should challenge your thinking, not replace it.*
* **Key Message:** The better your instructions, the better the output. We sometimes call this "prompt engineering" - but it's really just giving clear instructions.

## **Part 3: The "Board of Directors" Strategy (7 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Use multi-perspective prompting for teaching and planning decisions.

* **Concept:** Instead of asking AI for one answer, ask it to simulate multiple perspectives.
* **The Activity (Live Demo):** Use an education-relevant example.
* **The Prompt:**
    > "I'm redesigning my assessment for a second-year management unit.
    > Act as my advisory board and analyse this from multiple perspectives:
    > 1. As Learning Designer: Alignment with outcomes?
    > 2. As Academic Integrity Officer: AI vulnerability?
    > 3. As Student Advocate: Workload and clarity?
    > 4. As Industry Partner: Real-world relevance?
    > For each perspective, give me 3-4 key considerations."

## **Part 4: The Devil's Advocate (6 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Use the debate/critique strategy to stress-test positions.

* **Concept:** Educators often have strong positions. Use AI to find the weaknesses.
* **The Prompt:**
    > "I believe that banning AI from assessments is the best approach for maintaining academic integrity. Play devil's advocate. Be harsh but fair. Tell me exactly why this might fail."
* **Lesson:** This teaches stress-testing thinking, not just text generation.

## **Part 5: Reverse Prompting (7 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Let AI interview YOU for tailored recommendations.

* **Concept:** Sometimes we don't know what to ask. Let the AI interview us.
* **The Prompt:**
    > "I want to create a policy for AI use in my units. Before giving me any advice, interview me first. Ask me questions one at a time about my teaching context, concerns, and goals. Then give me tailored recommendations."
* **Lesson:** Generic prompts get generic answers. Context produces actionable insights.

## **Part 6: Assessment Reality (10 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Address the elephant in the room - AI and assessments.

* **The Stress-Test:** Run your assessment through AI. If it passes, the assessment was already breakable.
* **Three Options:**
  - **Process Documentation:** AI transcript + annotations + reflection
  - **In-Class Components:** AI draft before class, in-class critique
  - **Personal Application:** Local context, primary data, unique perspective
* **Key Message:** AI doesn't break assessments; it reveals what was already breakable.

## **Part 7: Ethics & Next Steps (8 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Ethics, verification, and commitment to action.

* **The Billboard Rule:** "If you wouldn't put it on a billboard, don't put it in AI."
* **Three Verification Questions:** Can I find this independently? Does it appear elsewhere? Does it make logical sense?
* **One Commitment:** What small experiment will you try this week?
