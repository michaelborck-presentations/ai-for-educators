# Image Prompts for AI for Educators Slides

These prompts generate rough, childlike sketches for each slide. The "ugly sketch" approach engages the brain and improves retention - beautiful slides make people admire the design, rough sketches make people think about the content.

**Style instruction to prepend to each prompt:**
> Simple rough sketch drawn by a 5-year-old child using thick crayons or markers. Wobbly lines, imperfect shapes, childlike simplicity. White background. No text or labels.

## Notes for Image Generation

1. **Consistency**: Use the same style prefix for all prompts to maintain visual consistency
2. **Simplicity**: If the AI generates something too complex, simplify the prompt
3. **No text**: Avoid any text or labels in the images - let the speaker provide context
4. **Colour**: Bright, primary crayon colours work well (red, blue, yellow, green)
5. **Imperfection**: The wobblier and more childlike, the better - resist the urge to make them "nice"

## Updating slides.qmd

After generating images, update each slide in `source/slides.qmd` to reference the new image:
